# Modern Mehrunes' Razor (OpenMW)

Adds instakill chance to the Mehrunes' Razor. Daedric Banishing style.

Let's be real, does anyone like vanilla Mehrunes' Razor? Me neither. Daedric artifacts in my opinion need to be unique and memorable and later games really nailed it. That's why I'm presenting you a daedric artifact WORTHY of the name of the daedric prince of destruction itself!

## Features

### Presets (in percents)
- Oblivion -> PlayerLuck * 0.05
- Skyrim -> 2/101 (1.98%)
- Custom -> BaseChance + PlayerLuck * LuckModifier
- Cheater -> yes

### Enemy Luck Counters
Option to add (-EnemyLuck * EnemyLuckModifier) to the end of equation. All toggleable and configurable.

### Effects!
Not really. Just pop-up message like in Oblivion and vanilla crit sfx on instakill. All toggleable.

## Requirements
- OpenMW July 2025 dev build or newer (API version 87 or newer)

## Installation
Installs like any other OpenMW mod. Not sure about pre-0.49 OpenMW support, but you should use newest builds anyway.

There's also optional omwaddon which removes all enchantments from Mehrunes' Razor.

## Compatibility
Yes.

They won't nessecarily work well with this mod, but they're still cool in my opinion.
