# Modern Mehrunes' Razor (OpenMW)

Adds instakill chance to the Mehrunes' Razor. Daedric Banishing style.

The mod doesnt change the Mehrunes' Razor in any way, it just adds additional Lua script for it.

## Presets
- Oblivion -> PlayerLuck * 0.05
- Skyrim -> 2/101 (1.98%)
- Custom -> BaseChance + PlayerLuck * LuckModifier
- Cheater -> yes

## Requirements
- OpenMW July 2025 dev build or newer (API version 87 or newer)

## Installation
Installs like any other OpenMW mod. Not sure about pre-0.49 OpenMW support, but you should use newest builds anyway.

There's also optional omwaddon which removes all enchantments from Mehrunes' Razor. In case you want to balance out this buff. It's also safe to install and uninstall it mid-playthrough.

## Compatibility
Yes.

## Other cool Mehrunes' Razor mods

They won't nessecarily work well with this mod, but they're still cool in my opinion.
